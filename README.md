InternetScriptingCoursework

This is the completed coursework. I created this repo after the coursework was completed. The project breif is in this repo and will explain what was asked of us. I decided to go down the Razor page route as I chose the MVC route in the class test. I wanted to have experience of both in the cotext of .NET

.Net 3.0 was used for this project and module as 5.0 was released too late in the year for the module to have been written for it in time for us.
